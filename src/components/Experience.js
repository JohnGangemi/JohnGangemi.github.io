                Researched the design and synthesis of combinational feedback logic
                with FPGAs. In particular, I attempted to mitigate the complications
                that arise when modeling asynchronous combinational circuits in FPGA
                fabric and sought-out solutions from published scholarly journals,
                web articles, online forums, and professionals in the industry.
